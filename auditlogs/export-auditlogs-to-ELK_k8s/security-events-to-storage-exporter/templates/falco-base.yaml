  # Although Falco comes with a nice default rule set for detecting weird
  # behavior in containers, our users are going to customize the run-time
  # security rule sets or policies for the specific container images and
  # applications they run. This feature can be handled in this section.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # rules-traefik.yaml: |-
  #   [ rule body ]

# certificates used by webserver and grpc server
# paste certificate content or use helm with --set-file
# or use existing secret containing key, crt, ca as well as pem bundle
